# Feit-Thompson conjecture on primes

*Reference:* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feit%E2%80%93Thompson_conjecture)
-/

/--
Are there any primes p and q such that (q^p - 1) / (q - 1) divides (p^q - 1) / (p - 1)?

theorem feit_thompson_primes (p q : ℕ) (hp : Prime p ∧ Prime q) (h : p < q) :
  ¬ (q ^ p - 1) / (q - 1) ∣ (p ^ q - 1) / (p - 1) := by
