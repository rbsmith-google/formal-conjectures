# Conjectures about the Mandelbrot and Multibrot sets
This file adds three conjectures about the Mandelbrot and Multibrot sets:
- the *MLC conjecture*, stating that these sets are locally connected
- the *density of hyperbolicity* conjecture, stating that parameters with attracting cycles are
  dense in the Mandelbrot and Multibrot sets
- the conjecture that the boundaries of these sets have zero area.
The first two conjectures are related in that the former implies the latter.
