A rational field extension is a field extension `L/K` isomorphic
to a field of rational functions (in some arbitrary number of indeterminates.)

`K, L` are isomorphic as `K` algebras. -/

We say that a rational extension `L` of `K` has the _Noether Property_
if for any finite subgroup `H` of the Galois group of `L`, the fixed field
`L^H` is also a rational extension.

The **Noether Problem**: let `L` be the field of rational functions in `n`
indeterminates over `K`. Is it true that `L/K` has the Noether property?

Solution: False.

One can find a counterexample to the Noether Problem's claim by considering a
rational function field in 47 indeterminates.
